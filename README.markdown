Leafman
===============
Leafman is a project manager, particularly useful if you are a freelance hacker like me. After all, I originally developed this just for myself, but then pushed it to Github for everyone to enjoy.

Repository Support
-----------------------
* Git (green)
* Subversion (blue)
* Bazaar (yellow)
* Mercurial (cyan)
* Darcs (purple)

I have no intention of supporting CVS, it's just too outdated for me.

Examples
--------------------
    $ ruby leafman.rb create|destroy \<project\>
This will create/destroy a project.
    $ ruby leafman.rb list
This gives you a list of all projects.
    $ ruby leafman.rb show \<project\>
This shows detailed information on a project.

Also, really useful:
    $ ruby leafman.rb help
for all commands.
